The end of our best friend : the token.

With the new NFC card student, each tek is known.

After an activity or an exam, the supervisor (APE, AER) can open our software, select the activity and launch the validation session.
Thanks to a NFC Reader provided, the students have only to pass the card above the reader and that's done. He is now present on the Intranet and we know his time out.

# Client JavaFX
The Java client was made with JavaFX in Java8.

We used the JFoenix library (for the MaterialDesign in general) and the ACR library for the NFC Reader.

Navigation with TabPane, almost things managed thanks to TableView.
